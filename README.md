# simpleCRUD

Front-end template for CRUD operation with Sign Up and Login Page setup and Navigation.
 Use this template with any of the Back-end Technology (django, spring boot, .NET ...etc.)


# Some Important Notes:

Use the base.html file as Layout page for rest of the pages and include other pages inside the block as required.

Aleart message feature is there inside the base.html (layout) you can use it to display the message.
 If you dont want that feature please delete that block of code with some Javascript code that I clearly mentioned inside base.html documentation. 


# Happy Programming...
